            <h3>Holy Cross Robotics Club</h3>
            <p>In the fall of 2024, A friend and I (Ben McCalmon) decided to found a robotics club at our liberal arts college. We scheduled weekly meeting with two proffesors who were willing to support our club and were given funding from our computer science department. The club bought a robotic arm that we seeked to control and move in 3d space. We used python to communicate with the robot and send bits back and forth. After months of work we were able to communicate with the robot, instructing it to move to a specific cordinate on a 3d plan giving us full control.</p>

            <h3>HcMarket</h3>
            <p>In the fall of 2024 I took an additional Software Engineering night class. In this class the only thing we did was pick a project idea and work on it with two other classmates and report progress once a week. Through this project I learned how to work with others using github. Our idea revolved around a website were students would make listing for products they wanted to sell to other students, such as seniors moving out. We used Django for our backend, which I had never used before but it was interesting to learn. We also used SQlite for our database and HTML/CSS for our frontend. I assisted with features including a login/logout feature, storing account information, listing products, and a univerasal search bar for filtering items.</p>

            <h3>Breast Cancer Prediction Model</h3>
            <p>In the Spring of 2023, I decided to use elements of data mining to develop a breast cancer prediction model inspired by the recent passing of my mother due to breast cancer. The project's goal was to anaylze the Wisconsin Breast Caner Dataset and predict whether or not a given tumor would be benign or malignant. Challenges in the project included normalizing the data, training and testing the data, preventing overfitting and underfitting, logistic regression, and visulaizing the data using Matplotlib. I used the k-means machine learning algotihm on all of the data to cluster the tumors into groups benign and malignant and visualized these group using logistic regression through the use of sckitlearn libraries. </p>
