            <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
            <p>As a research assistant, I collaborated with a professor to develop a psychological study in Unity, aimed at testing cognitive processes in a virtual reality environment. My responsibilities included designing and implementing interactive features for the VR environment to simulate experimental conditions, optimizing the usability and functionality of the system, and ensuring the environment met the study's requirements. Additionally, I assisted in troubleshooting technical challenges, testing the VR setup, and refining the design to enhance participant experience and study reliability. All code was writeen in C# using unity.</p>

            <h3>iD Tech Instructor</h3>
            <p>Over the summer of 2024, I spent my time working as a intructor for iD Tech Camps. Here, I would teach mostly highschool students the fundamentals of propgramming through projects. I tought three courses, Advanced Java, Advanced Java For Minecraft Modding, and Intro to Unreal Engine. Here over the course of a week I would teach one of these courses to a group of students. Students would be given range to choose any poject they like and I would assist them with bringing their ideas to life while teahcing them the fundementals of programming. At the end of the week, each student would show off their project to everyone else in our class. </p>
